## Daily Journal - Read Building Blocks Of Web Development > CSS and answer the following questions

1. What is a Pseudo-Class and what are some of the most common ones you think you will use
    -A pseudo-class helps style elements based off their value in relation to other elements and rules, but also towards external factors. The two I believe I will use the most will be :hover, in order to style certain shading to elements if an user intends to use a certain button or element, and also :active to help activate a button for example that a user intends to use to help enable that functionality, but can still be overridden if there is higher specifier.

2. What is Specificity and how might you use it to your benefit?
    -Specificty helps organize styling based on the selectors value to help organize and apply, or not apply, certain rules to certain elements.

3. What problems do you think you could run into if you over-utilized the !important feature?
    -Overutilizing the !important feature may make it difficult to later decipher and debug certain code within similar declarations or elements because if everything is !important than is anything really !important? Important to use it sparingly to single out specific buttons or certain styling that would otherwise be difficult to target.
