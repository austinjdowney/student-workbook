## Day 4 - WIRE-FRAMING, DESIGN TOOLS AND REVIEW

## Afternoon partner challenge: https://github.com/austinjdowney/JohnDeere-Challenge.git

## Daily Journal - Read Building Blocks Of Web Development > Wire-framing: A Comprehensive Guide and answer the following questions

1. What is the purpose of wire-framing?
Creating a visual representation of what you'd like a page to look like prior to actually writting out the full code. May vary between low to high-fodelity in the quality of the visual representation, but ultimately intended to optimize the user's experience, whether for a desktop websites or even mobile applications.

2. What are the different levels of detail in wire-frames and why is each one useful?

There are typically 3 levels of detail between wire-frames, ranging from low, mid, and high quality wire-frames. Low wire-frames are the most basic representations that only include a rough outline and general text/visual representions to display to a potential user. Mid quality wire-frames are the typically the most common and display a higher level of detail to more clearly identify different components and placement of images, but also more likely to identity containers and titles based off vary weights of text. High quality wire-frames will display the actual text and images intended to be displayed to the user, instead of lorem ipsum autofills and X's as placeholders. Since high quality wire-frames are much more complex, they are typically saved for the end of a design cycle once a majority of the information and optimal design for a more interactive experience has been decided.

3. Do you think wire-frames are worth the Time, Energy, and Effort that they require? Why or Why not?

I believe wire-frames can be very useful to help design the best gameplan for a project to know what will look best for your website and then write your code from there without having to do trial and error and wasting energy plugging in random information to see if the design is satisfactory. However, I believe depending on the project, one must not spend an abundant amount of energy on a high quality wire-frame if the product or project may not call for such high level of detail.
