## Day 3 = Building blocks of web development

## DailyChallenge: Morning:https://github.com/austinjdowney/stoplightchallenge.git AFTERNOON:

Daily Journal - Read Building Blocks Of Web Development > Cheating At Design and answer the following questions

1. What is your favorite tip that you think is the most beneficial to improving your design?

An underrated subtlety while designing is not being so quick on the draw on creating border outlines. Simply use two different colors to create the distinction, which achieves the same purpose most of the time and is easier on the user.

2. Compile a couple resources that you think might be helpful when trying to review examples of good design ideas.

Bootstrapmade.com and www.awwwards.com/websites/bootstrap/ both provide plenty of examples of designs, not just possible with bootstrap, but hints at how the layouts were made, as well.

3. How do you think good design influences people when visiting a website and what sorts of things could you convey through design alone?

The aesthetic and layout of a website provides an optimal opportunity that the user will at least attempt to stay and want to see more of what your content has to offer. However, if the layout is complex and isn't formatted in a way that makes it easy for a user to navigate the website, then that increases the likelihood the user may not view your page again.
