<html> tags, technically contain all of the information in a html document, but then it'd be the <body> tags that is all information that is actually going to be shown, then <head> tags that help define the information that isn't displayed on the screen, but defines how the screen may be displayed and other information that may need to be linked and then referenced further in the body tags (CSS, bootstrap, Font-awesome, etc.).

<ul></ul> or unordered lists are used to make lists that don't necessarily need to be in a specific order, but just in a listed fashion and use <li></li>, as well, similar to the ordered lists.

<dl></dl> Descriptive lists are typically used to help define a specific over arching term using <dt></dt> tags and then use <dd></dd> tags to then list all the pertinent information underneath.
