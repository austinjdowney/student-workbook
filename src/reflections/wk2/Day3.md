Daily Journal
Read Intro to JS > Chrome Developer Tools and answer the following questions
1. What are the main ways to write information to the console? Why/when should you use each style.

Using a debugger is one common way to check your code thru your console tab line by line so you can more effectively see step by step how everything is running, especially when evaluating conditional statements and also testing a funcitons functionality to make certain they are written in the proper syntax for their intended purpose. Console.log() is another common way to check for you errors or functionality in your code thru your console.

2. Which tab allows you to see the breakdown of HTML/CSS and how can this tab be useful when debugging HTML?

The Elements tab allows you manipulate your HTML code and your CSS in a way that is "temporary" but more efficient way in checking certain conditions before writing them in your code and having to go back and forth between pages. In this tab the changes won't be saved directly thru the Elements tab, but can still be directly copied and pasted into your code after gathering a more immediate visual of what the code will then look like. 

3. Outside of writing everything to the console, what is a better way to debug your code?

Using Break Points and JavaScript Debugging (commonly know as the "debugger") allow you to evaluate line by line how a code is being evaluated, even when there is not an error being displayed, but also useful if your code isn't behaving as intended.
