Read Intro to JS > The Mistakes I Made As a Beginner Programmer and answer the following questions

1. What are the benefits of making a plan before starting to just write the code?

You are able to strategize how to tackle your project without just starting impulsively at a random spot and having to adjust your code from there without even trying to have an outline or gameplan somewhat in your mind. However, over-planning or over-thinking also, can also hinder development if trying to tackle too many problems before attempting to impliment your code or idea.

2. How do you find answers when you are stuck?

Debugging your code and checking what errors occus is a good place to start, but keeping your code concise makes the process of narrowing down where you may have a problem a lot easier than a large block of code. Also, not being afraid to use Google because someone may have found a more optimal process for what you may have thought as a "big" problem that they actually already solved. In addition to this though, don't always take Google for its word even if there has been a lot of people that have used their idea. Be optimisitic, but also objective and critical of the answer still.


3. From the entire article what are your biggest takeaways?

Keeping code clean and concise. I will sometimes over explain something as is and have the occassional run on sentence as is when writing. However, I have practiced to try and catch myself in these situations when I know it is avoidable. Also, not being afraid of using Google and trying to reinvent the wheel for a problem I may be stuck on. At the same time though, still being aware of what some bad practices are to be able to spot them and possibly make the code more effecient for my intended purpose. Another big takeaway, taking breaks... because I can definintely catch tunnel vision when I am into a problem.
