## Daily Journal
Read Intro to JS > Var, let and const and answer the following questions
1. What is Scope ?

    Where your variables are available for use. <!--Var=global or whole document and let+cons=block which are within curly brackets{}>>

2. What is Hoisting ?

    Moves the variables and/or function declarations to the top of your scope.

3. In what cases might you use let vs const vs var?

    var is intended for global application to a whole document, while let is scoped to the block <!--{}--> that you are working within and is more easily changed counter tot var. Const is also intended for just within the block, similar to let, but const is not able to be changed to a similar value, such as "" to "", but can be updated if adding the number of times you'd like the function to run relative to the "" value.
