## Day1: Team Capstones

## Daily Journal

Reflect on your capstone project so far and answer the following questions

1. What technologies and principles are you using in your project?

Incorporating 2 different Api's (i.e., Open Weather Api and Environmental News Feed Api) and also doing calculcations for an individual's Carbon Emissions based off their Home monthly utilities (i.e., water and electric) and their miles driven in their car (i.e., relative to gas type of that vehicle there are different calculations).

2. What went well so far?

Efficient on planning everything out and gathering a well thought out overall gestalt for the project to make it practical, yet,  well-designed.

3. What would you do differently? Why?

Possibly rotating jobs a bit more frequently on the front-end, but everything has been going smoothly anyways.
