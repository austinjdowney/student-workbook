1. How are some ways Scrum for a small team would differ from Scrum with a large team?

With a small team communication is a lot easier and voices are most likely heard more to gather more of an ideal gestalt of where everyone is at. However, with a larger team since there are more voices, you may have more ideas or more thoughts being able to be thrown around rather than being limited to a select few, but when there are more voices trying to be heard, that may overwhelm other voices to not be heard, as well. 

2. Why does Scrum prescribe to only run 1 sprint at a time.

Similar to the SOLID principles.. single responsibility to focus on a single task or product at a time and provide the best quality product in the most efficient amount of time. The more sprints there are, the less time a developer has to actually work on the product.

3. What is the unattainable triangle and what purpose does it have in Scrum?

Unattainable Triangle:
-Good service Cheap won't be Fast
-Good service Fast won't be Cheap
-Fast service Cheap won't be Good

Focusing on a single service and relaying to the Product Owner(i.e., who will relay to the customer) the ideal amount of time to complete the best MVP possible (i.e., possibly with a week or two cushion to make certain at least the MVP is done but possibly hitting a stretch goal or two without delaying the finished product tooooo long). The PO relaying the ideal amount of time to customer, without a pricetag, allows the customer to figure out if it is worth waiting that alloted amount of time until product deployment and then cost may vary even up until the actual finished product is done.
