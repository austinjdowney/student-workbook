Read Advancing with Vue 3 > Designing a Strong User Experience and answer the following questions

1. What is a User Experience? What should be considered when developing a User Experience?

User Experience is every interaction a potential user may have on your website, mobile site, apps and online properties/services. Taking into account every user and possible way a user may need to account is the most ideal, because at the end of the day the whole point of a User Experience is the experience for the user and what THEY want.

2. What are some benefits of taking into account the User Experience?

Taking into account the User Experience can make your code more efficient (making certain every intended action should be done within 5 steps tops... For example, to "make a purchase," people would need to:

1.Land on the homepage
2.Click product category
3.Click product page
4.Check out) so plan out as many goals as conceivable prior to coding to help best identify each relationship

Understand the user's emotional experience and what you intend for them to want to feel and do.. will dramatically help with designing and the user experience (whether a spa website and people should feel relaxed or an outdoors website and you want people to feel excited and adventurous)

Use paint or figma or even a sketchpad/whiteboard to do a wireframe and general to plan out how you'd like to design your app/website visually to more ideally know how to start with your front end experience

3. Why is the User Experience important?

User Experience is important but because if you are designing for a website or an app, the amount of traffic going thru there is main focus and if the app is not very funcitonal or has well designed usability or attractive to the eye and doesn't keep people on the page, then their isn't a point in that code necessarily... design the best you can and even keep it simple functionally if need be.
