## Day4: Checkpoint

## Daily Journal

Reflect on your partner project and answer the following questions

1. Which principles from this weeks reading did you implement?

Coding with a partner and allocating the proper responsibilities to not just account for our own strengths but also help try to develop and strengthen our weaknesses. 

Additionally, keeping into account functionality and to make certain that the user is able to navigate the website in the best way possible.

2. What went well?

We were both able to switch on and off relatively easily and complimented each other's strengths and weaknesses pretty well. We were able to keep each other on track and not waste time stewing and not being productive.

3. What would you do differently?

I would take more of a lead on designing the website and enforce more of an emphasis on it at the beginning, but other than that I think we did a really good job together.
