Read Advancing with Vue 3 > Code documentation for JavaScript with JSDoc: an introduction and answer the following questions
1. What is Code Documentation? What are some of the ways to document code?

Code Documentation helps provide an outline or some background to some of the unique parts of your code to help guide them through your process. Especially if you are not present to help explain any parts. A good READMe .. a thorough HowTo guides for your code.. but ultimately documenting (comments) innside the code itself next to the code you are attempting to explain is most valuable.

2. What are some benefits of Code Documentation?

Code Documentation helps whomever reads your code with informing them the purpose of your functions thru ideal naming conventions, whether it is funciton names, variable names, pretty much anything that makes the readability easier even for the most lay programmer.

Adding comments about what the function is intending to return for any individual that may be liking to use your code and may not know how to reapply the code in an ideal way and then gets something in RETURN that may not have expected.


3. How important is Code documentation and why?

Code documentation is good practice especially for young programmers to just continue throughout their career and to help not develop bad habits. Code documentation helps with repeating your process, which in turn helps with recalling later, but also for future programmers on why you coded what you did instead of having to guess.
