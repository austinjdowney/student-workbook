1. What is Pair Programming? What are the roles and how do they work?

Pair Programming is when there are two developers sharing a screen, keyboard, and mouse.. the one physcially using the keyboard and mouse is called the DRIVER, while the other programmer, whom is still actively part of the programming but more concerned with the overall direction and is doing more of the research and helping navigate the driver (called the NAVIGATOR).

2. What are some benefits of Pair Programming?

Great for Pedagogic purposes of teaching a more beginner programmer the necessity of how to best use the software and adapt to it.. transfer of skills and diffusion of knowledge

Programming out loud leads to clearer articulation of complexities and hidden details in coding tasks, ideally reducing the errors or going down a rabbit hole.

reducing coordination efforts since you have half the amount of people to worry about tasking since they are in pairs

One person will usually always remained focus even if one person gets distracted.. ideally being able to pull the other prgrammer back in and not going down a rabbit hole

3. What are some drawbacks to Pair Programming?

15% higher overhead but is ideally shown still shown to produce higher quality of code
