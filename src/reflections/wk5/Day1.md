Read Servers with Node/Express > Using Query Parameters and answer the following questions

1. What is the purpose of a Query String?

To pass information to and from a website by appending it onto the end of a URL. Information is then stored on the QString and then captured by the website.

2. What is the format of a query parameter? How does it start? How do you distinguish between one parameter and the next?

A query parameter starts after the ? in a URL. If there are multiple parameters in the URL then they are seperated by an &. If a parameter appears multiple times in a QString then the express will group the values in an array.

3. When do you think Query parameters would be helpful when writing your server?

Query parameters will be helpful in more easily sending or even editing (i.e. filter) more information to your server .
