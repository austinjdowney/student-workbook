## Day 2: USING AN ORM TO INTERACT WITH A DATABASE

## Afternoon Challenge: 



Daily Journal
Read Servers with Node/Express > MongoDb Relationships and answer the following questions

1. What are the three types of relationships?

1:1: one to one 
1:N one to many
N:M many to many

2. What are the benefits of the traditional linking of relationships instead of Embedding?

<!------------------Is this right???-------------------->

Traditional linking may be more optimal because you have more flexibility in assigning "foreign keys" instead of having it embedded and not as flexibile to be subjected to change.

3. What are some of the challenges faced when deciding how to manage a many-to-many relationship that ultimately drive your decision on how to create it?
