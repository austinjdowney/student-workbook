Read Advancing with JS > ES6 modules and answer the following questions

1. What problem does using exports solve?

Helps isolate problems to individual files to make it easier to debug but also helps break up code so you don't have a single page of a plethora of code that may make it harder to distinguish where certain parts are at .

2. How does export differ from export default?

Export default exports the entire page of code to whereever you are intending to send the file too, but export allows you send specific information to a certain file.

3. What is a benefit of using the Module System?

Breaks up code to specific purposes to make it easier for organization and debugging. Allows for modules to use similar naming conventions without the complexity of having to specify them and having them clash together. The singular purpose of each file helps break down and protect that code.
