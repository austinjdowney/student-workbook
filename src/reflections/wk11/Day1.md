Read Foundations of C# > C# Inheritance and answer the following questions
1. What does Inheritance accomplish for us in C#?

Inheritance allows us to take elements from one class (base class) and pass those shared elements to the other class (derived class) since they have the same properties as is to save time 

2. How does Member inheritance work in C#? Does a class inherit all members of the base class?

You bind the base class to the derived class to save time and space while coding and since the derived class inherits all of the same elements from the base class that holds all of the shared elements already, then you can also call on the base class as well if there are elements from the derived class you don't wish to also show

2. How does accessibility affect inheritance?

All public elements will be shared from the base class to the derived class but if any elements in the derived class deemed private then they are not accessible to the other class.
