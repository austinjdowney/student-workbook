## Day3: FINAL CHECKPOINT

## Daily Journal
Final Checkpoint
During this final checkpoint simply journal your progress as you build the app. What have you achieved so far, what are you working on now, and what roadblocks are you currently overcoming. Feel free to take this time to express how you are feeling now at the end of the course, reflecting on everything you have learned so far.

FINALLY GOT ALL OF THE TESTS PASSING. Not going to touch my server at all.. Needing to style a bit more, but I have everything but vaultkeeps populating to the page and am able to delete everything.
