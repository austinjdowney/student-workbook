## Daily Journal
Final Checkpoint
During this final checkpoint simply journal your progress as you build the app. What have you achieved so far, what are you working on now, and what roadblocks are you currently overcoming. Feel free to take this time to express how you are feeling now at the end of the course, reflecting on everything you have learned so far.

Vaultkeeps are being difficult.. Got them to populate, but not wanting to delete properly.. Also private vaults are so secure even if I create one I can't even see it.. But those are the last two things. Being able to delete vaultkeeps and able to have my own private vaults to appear. Then just some styling tweaks.
