## Day2: FINAL CHECKPOINT

## Daily Journal
Final Checkpoint
During this final checkpoint simply journal your progress as you build the app. What have you achieved so far, what are you working on now, and what roadblocks are you currently overcoming. Feel free to take this time to express how you are feeling now at the end of the course, reflecting on everything you have learned so far.

Needing to finish my server side tests, but I have a majority of my client side pages and components worked out. Create Modals are creating, so just needing to populate onto the page properly.
