## Day1: FINAL CHECKPOINT

## Daily Journal
Final Checkpoint
During this final checkpoint simply journal your progress as you build the app. What have you achieved so far, what are you working on now, and what roadblocks are you currently overcoming. Feel free to take this time to express how you are feeling now at the end of the course, reflecting on everything you have learned so far.

Struggling with getting postman to work... focusing on trying to set up the client side framework as much as I can without getting too far in depth and having to change a whole bunch of other stuff later on.
