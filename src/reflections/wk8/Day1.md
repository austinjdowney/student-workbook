Read Working In a Professional Environment > An Honest Guide to Building a Powerful Developer Portfolio and answer the following questions

1. What function does a developer Portfolio provide?

ROI on Portfolios:

-Increased visibility and authority.

-A way to prove you know your craft.

-A background of work allowing you to get that first position in the industry.

-It can show your expertise on a subject.

-Increasing your personal brand.

-Stand out from a crowd of candidates in interviews.

2. What makes a Developer Portfolio effective?

Having a diversity of projects that best reflect your aptitutde and cummulative knowledge. Quality of code definitely matters more than the subject matter itself.

-build something you care about that you can really put time into (whether for a family member or even a friend)

-build something for a local business
  --more competitive environment, but also displays networking skills, and problably more importantly adapatability to an unknown environment.

-build something tailored to your needs
  --similar to the first point.. you will probably care more about this topic, whether out of necessity or just interest, but will not just satisfy that longing need, but also may be a great portfolio piece

-build a clone
  if you can build something already out there but improve upon it that will really show that you have a good sense of what is quality and what is not

    --build a clone of the company's website you may really want to work for 
      -a bit proactive but shows off not just your technical skills but critical/qualitative thinking skills to improve their own product

-Use course projects to advantage

-Positive freelance experience



3. What projects do you have that you would include in your Portfolio? Why?

-inspire(maybe)
  --to display the wide variety of outside resources that were pulled in on that project.. but possibly expand a bit more upon it.. or even rebuild it in vue

-KanBan
  --I have already made some improvements on this project but maybe keep working on it a bit more to show what my initial first full-stack app in vue entailed and show what I changed it personally

-bug logger
  --since this was my first individual full-stack app I am wanting to use but I do want to improve the design aspect. 

EcoSistent
  --Second (first was first hackathon and definitely learned a lot and what could be improved) team built full-stack app that at the rate we are going are going to killll it (I literally knocked on wood immediately after typing that statement)
